# Project-2

In this readme we will explain how to run each code of each problem. As a general statement: each problem folder contains the things that were asked in that exercise, even if it needs functions from other problems in order to be executed. We did this because putting in each folder the things needed for executing the final cpp was going to consume a lot of space when downloading the full repository.



# Problem 3

In this problem the file "Problem3.hpp" should be in the same folder than "Problem3.cpp" to be able to run this program. (You can found this files in the folder Problem3). The file "Problem3.hpp" is just a function that checks if the eigenvalues and eigenvectors you put as an argument, are the same as the ones obtained analytically.


# Problem 4
The file "Problem4.hpp" is just the function that gets the maximum off-diagonal value of a symmetric matrix so it is not executable for itself. The file "Problem4b.cpp" is the one you can execute with an example inside. As in the previous exercise, you need to have both files


# Problem 5

For section a, you should get the files "Problem4a.hpp", "Problem5a-1.hpp" and "Problem5a-2.hpp" in the same folder that "Problem5a.cpp", and then, you have to run this last file.

For section b, you should include in the same folder than "Problem5b.cpp" files "Problem4a.hpp", "Problem5a-1.hpp", "Problem5a-2.hpp" and "Problem3.hpp". Then you will be able to run "Problem5b.cpp". 


# Problem 6

For section a, to run "Problem6a.cpp" you should include in the same folder files "Problem4a.hpp", "Problem5a-1.hpp" and "Problem5a-2.hpp". 

For section b, to run "Problem6b.cpp" you should include in the same folder files "Problem4a.hpp", "Problem5a-1.hpp" and "Problem5a-2.hpp". 

In order to run "Problem6a.py", you will need the file "iterations.txt" which you can generate via "Problem6a.cpp" or use directly the file in Problem6/Plots.

In order to run "Problem6b.py", you will need the files "iterations.txt" and "iterations_densematrix.txt" which you can generate via "Problem6a.cpp" and "Problem6b.cpp" or use directly the files in Problem6/Plots.


# Problem 7

For section a, to run "Problem7a.cpp" a you should include in the same folder files "Problem7a.txt" and "Problem7a.py". (The folder's name is Problem7a).

For section b, to run "Problem7b.cpp" a you should include in the same folder files "Problem7b.txt" and "Problem7b.py". (The folder's name is Problem7b).
