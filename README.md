# Project-2

In this readme we will explain how to run each code of each problem.

# Problem 3

In this problem the file "Problem3.hpp" should be in the same folder than "Problem3.cpp" to be able to run this program. (You can found this files in the folder Problem3).

# Problem 4

# Problem 5

For section a you should get the files "Problem4a.hpp", "Problem5a-1.hpp" and "Problem5a-2.hpp" in the same folder that "Problem5a.cpp", and then, you have to run this last file. (Every program can be found in folder "Problem5a").

For section b, you should include in the same folder than "Problem5b.cpp" files "Problem5a-2.hpp" and "Problem3.hpp". Then you will be able to run "Problem5b.cpp". (Every program can be found in folder "Problem5b").

# Problem 6

For section a, to run "Problem6a.cpp" you should include in the same folder files "Problem4a.hpp", "Problem5a-1.hpp" and "Problem5a-2.hpp". 

For section b, to run "Problem6b.cpp" you should include in the same folder files "Problem4a.hpp", "Problem5a-1.hpp" and "Problem5a-2.hpp". 

In order to run "Problem6a.py", you will need the file "iterations.txt" which you can generate via "Problem6a.cpp" or use directly the file in Problem6/Plots.

In order to run "Problem6b.py", you will need the files "iterations.txt" and "iterations_densematrix.txt" which you can generate via "Problem6a.cpp" and "Problem6b.cpp" or use directly the files in Problem6/Plots.

# Problem 7

For section a, to run "Problem7a.cpp" a you should include in the same folder files "Problem7a.txt" and "Problem7a.py". (The folder's name is Problem7a).

For section b, to run "Problem7b.cpp" a you should include in the same folder files "Problem7b.txt" and "Problem7b.py". (The folder's name is Problem7b).
